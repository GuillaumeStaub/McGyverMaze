=================                                                                       
Why this program? 
-----------------                                                                    
This game is a 2D labyrinth in which MacGyver has been locked up. The exit is supervised by a bodyguard whose hair would turn Tina Turner pale. To distract, you need to gather the following elements (scattered in the labyrinth): a needle, a small plastic tube and ether. They will allow MacGyver to create a syringe and lull the guard to go out of the labyrinth. The technical library used Pygame. This game is a practical application of the Openclassrooms App Developer in Python course. The skills mobilized:
